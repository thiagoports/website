        <h1>Professional Experience</h1>
        <p>
            I am currently in college and have been actively involved in various projects that contribute to my professional and personal development. Throughout my academic journey, I have participated in academic projects that allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge in practice, developing essential skills in teamwork, time management, and problem-solving.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, I have attended workshops that expanded my understanding of current and relevant topics in the field of technology, such as web development and interface design. These events have not only enriched my technical knowledge but also provided me the opportunity to interact with experienced professionals and learn from their insights.
        </p>
        <p>
            My involvement in extension projects has allowed me to collaborate with the community, utilizing my skills to promote improvements and innovations. These projects serve as an effective way to apply what Iâ€™ve learned in the classroom while contributing to social causes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The hackathons I participated in were intensive experiences that challenged my ability to create quick and efficient solutions to real-world problems. Working under pressure and within tight deadlines taught me the importance of agility and teamwork.
        </p>
        <p>
            These experiences have strengthened my professional profile, making me a more versatile candidate ready to face the challenges of the job market.
